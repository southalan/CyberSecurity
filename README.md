# CyberSecurity
A small set of documents that I have created for my clients, translated for the original language (Spanish) to English so you can have a sample of what clients are requiring from cybersec analysts. I suggest reading them in order. 

1) Incident response: An example of a preliminary analysis of a client calling me after a "virus" took control of his webpage. It was actually the "Japanese keyword hack" or the "Japanese SEO hack", a pretty interesting piece of malware that I would see it in more detail later.

2) Static analysis and Recovery: Deepening a little in the malware that caused the issue in the first place. We can actually see that is really big in obfuscation, using several neat tricks to avoid being detected by signature based AVs.
